## Custome Tailwind CSS  And Config Files

-> Custome Property:

In tailwind we have lot of  inbuild classes but at some  perticuler time if we want to  use any color or font which is  not present in tailwind css  then we  extend the propery  using the tailwind.config.js  file.

-> @apply Declaretive:

In Tailwind CSS, the @apply directive can be used to inline utility classes into custom CSS. This can be useful when you need to write custom CSS, but still want to work with your design tokens and use the same syntax you're used to using in your HTML
